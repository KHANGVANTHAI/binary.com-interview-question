# 1. Introduction

<center><iframe src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/englianhu/binary.com-interview-question/ff20ee95aa60ef5cca3cf797066089103eb62acf/reference/quant-analyst-skills-test.pdf" width="600" height="900"></iframe></center>

  For the question III, here I list down all possible scenario.
  
  - **Observation 1 :** The bets on the first six games, if each team wins three, must land you at wining/losing zero (I call this winnings of 00). If this is not the case, then no bet^[Or in token of place bet $1] on the last game achieves ±100.

  - **Observation 2 :** The bets on the first five games, if one team wins three of them, must land you at ±50 (+50 if team 1 wins three, −50 if team 2 wins three). Then (and only then) you can bet $50 on team 1 in game six and be assured of either immediately getting the proper result, or reaching a 3-3 tie at 00 winnings.

  - **Observation 3 :** The bets on the first four games, if each team wins two, must land you at 00 (and you bet $50 on team 1 in the next game).

  - **Observation 4 :** The bets on the first four games, if one team team wins three, must land you at ±75. Then you can bet $25 on team 1 and either terminate in the proper winnings or arrive at 3-2 at the proper amount ahead or behind.

  - **Observation 5 :** The bets on the first three games, if one team wins two, must land you at some value that allows you to reach either ±75 or 00 depending on the outcome of the fourth game. That implies that the wager in that situation must be $37.5 and that the bets on the first three games, if one team wins two, must land you at ±37.5.

  - **Observation 6 :** The bets on the first three games, if one team wins all three, must land you at some value that allows your next result to be ±100 or ±75 (see observation 4, which says in a 3-1 situation you need to be up or down by $75). The value that allows this is ±87.5 and the wager, of course, is $12.5.

  - **Observation 7 :** The bets on the first two games, if each team wins one, must land you even, and at that point you will bet $37.5 (see observation 5).

  - **Observation 8 :** The bets on the first two games, if one team wins both, must land you at some value that allows your next result to be ±87.5 or ±37.5, depending on the winner of game 3. Therefore, the bets on the first two games, if one team wins both, must land you at ±62.5 and you will bet $25.

  - **Observation 9 :** The bet on the first game must land you mid-way between even and ±62.5. Than means the first bet must be $31.25.

So here is your strategy:

  Bet $31.25 on team 1 in the first game. Then bet $31.25 on team 1 in the second game. At game three, if the teams are even, increase your bet for game three to $37.5. But if either team is up 2-0, decrease your bet to $25.

  After three games, if one team has won all three you will be ahead or behind by $87.5 and you will bet $12.5 on the fourth game. But if either team is ahead 2-1, you will be ahead or behind by $37.5 and you will bet $37.5 on the fourth game.

  After four games, if the series is not over, you will either be even and bet $50 on game five, or ahead or behind by $75, in which case you will bet on $25.

  After five games either the series will be over, or you will be ahead or behind by $50, in which case you will bet $50 on game six.

  And of course if the teams are tied after six games, then you are even as well, and you bet the full $100 on the final game.

  Due to the betting strategy for question III has indenpent probability 50% without any edge, now we look at the soccer scores modelling and Kelly criterion betting strategy which is the best strategy for professional gamblers. Here I do not repeat the same model applicable to the English soccer leagues.

# 2. Data

  Kindly refer to [Odds Modelling and Testing Inefficiency of Sports Bookmakers](https://github.com/scibrokes/odds-modelling-and-testing-inefficiency-of-sports-bookmakers) to know the English soccer dataset.

# 3. Statiscal Modelling

  Kindly refer to [Odds Modelling and Testing Inefficiency of Sports Bookmakers](https://github.com/scibrokes/odds-modelling-and-testing-inefficiency-of-sports-bookmakers) for statistical modelling.

# 4. Betting Strategy

  Kindly refer to [Application of Kelly Criterion model in Sportsbook Investment](https://github.com/scibrokes/kelly-criterion) to know the betting strategy applied to English soccer leagues over 2 years.

# 5. Return of Investment

  Kindly refer to [Application of Kelly Criterion model in Sportsbook Investment](https://github.com/scibrokes/kelly-criterion) to know the return of investment applied to English soccer leagues over 2 years.

# 6. Conclusion

  From the papers, we know that from my firstly betting strategy with $1 on every single match whith an edge of overcame the handicap, it might be win or loss depends the level of edge. In later paper I applied Kelly criterion method and get a confirmed ROI over 2 years.
